# presto-core
Restaurant Reservation - Core (BackEnd) Component

If you don't have the virtualenv setup, follow these steps:

pip install virtualenv

cd ~/presto-core

virtualenv {env name} # I called it ".end", the dot makes it hidden so you don't push that directory to github

source {env name}/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt # this should install the proper versions for you

deactivate # whenever you want to exit the virtual env.
